      <h2>Why does dictation work?</h2>
      <p>
        Writing has proven to be an essential practice when learning a foreign
        language. By writing the words, your brain can thoroughly grasp the
        content and absorb the vocabulary and grammar to access the information
        in the future. Plus, writing allows students to visualize and understand
        how to use words naturally in a sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, writing in a foreign language helps all other faculties,
        including speaking and listening. Unlike simply listening to a podcast
        or video, the act of dictating turns a passive listening activity into
        an active engagement with the language.
      </p>
      <br />
